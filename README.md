# Blog Card Masonry Layout

This project is a modern and elegant blog card masonry layout built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to be responsive and visually appealing, with a clean, magazine-like feel.

## Features

*   **Responsive Masonry Layout:** The layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop, using a cross-browser compatible `column-count` CSS implementation.
*   **Category Filtering:** Users can filter the blog cards by category ("Design", "Technology", "Lifestyle") with smooth animations.
*   **Subtle Animations:**
    *   **Hover Effects:** Cards lift slightly with a soft shadow when hovered over.
    *   **Fade-in on Scroll:** Cards gently fade in as they are scrolled into view, implemented with the `IntersectionObserver` API.
*   **Modern Design:** The project uses a light, elegant color palette and clean typography (Poppins and Inter from Google Fonts).
